    "# Manufacturing Root Cause Analysis Using Causal AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Root cause analysis in manufacturing is essential for uncovering the underlying issues that result in defects, inefficiencies, and failures. By identifying the true sources of problems, manufacturers can implement targeted solutions to prevent recurrence, improving product quality, reducing waste, and enhancing operational efficiency. Additionally, effective root cause analysis ensures compliance with industry standards, minimizes safety risks, and bolsters a manufacturer’s competitive edge in the market."

    "## Challenges with traditional machine learning approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Many manufacturers rely on traditional machine learning techniques based on correlations to address this problem. However, these techniques have significant limitations in root cause analysis due to their inability to capture causality. They often fail to distinguish true root causes from mere symptoms, oversimplifying complex manufacturing processes into tabular data while neglecting the manufacturing process flows. By prioritizing predictive power over causal understanding, these algorithms risk misidentifying root causes. Consequently, they can lead to misleading conclusions. See the section `Appendix B` in the notebook `05_appendix` for more information."

    "## Enhancing root cause analysis with causal AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal AI enhances root cause analysis in manufacturing by modeling cause-and-effect relationships within complex production processes, moving beyond mere correlations. It utilizes domain knowledge, often represented as knowledge graphs, to capture the causal relationships among critical variables in manufacturing. This approach distinguishes actual root causes from symptoms, enabling more precise identification of issues and their origins. By integrating observational data from production lines with causal insights, causal AI offers actionable recommendations for defect prevention and process optimization."
